              Scored for two altos and synthesizer (or bass, lute, bagpipe, trombone, marimba, and percussion). This recording substitutes saxophones for altos. A piece exploring alternate rhythms. (The primary time signature is five beats of dash-dotted quarters, and a dotted eighth.  See my <a href="placenotation.html">essay on modifications to music notation</A> if you want to know what a dash-dotted quarter is.)  Part of a larger song cycle inspired by the essays of Ingrid Hansen Smythe.

              An experiment with alternate tuning. I used synthesized band instruments retuned to 16 semitones per octave.  This meant that minor thirds were the only interval recognized as normal, and diminished triads the only chords that sounded familiar.  The bad tuning put me in mind of a high school jazz band.  The original recording is, unfortunately, lost.

            </DT>
            <DD>
              Word got around, in the space activist community, that what we really needed was a rousing anthem, and that if only we'd sing together in mutual harmony and understanding, the rockets would go up and the solar power satellites would get built. This is my attempt, using Alexander Courage's opening theme from Star Trek as the cantus firmus (and that's not easy!), and appropriately international Esperanto lyrics by my mother, Jean Smythe:

              A suite of seven variations, co-written with Gordon Rumson, using three Russion folk songs. Each of us composed one part of some of the seven variations, then passed the piece on to the other, who composed the missing part. The variations are a metaphor for a train journey across Russia, starting with a View of Japan and ending as the train arrives in Moscow with Bells of Mother Russia.

              An easy piece so long as you have big hands, having an improvisatory feel.  Reading the score is difficult not because the notes are hard to play, but that standard notation does not deal well with chords built up a note at a time.
