      <HR>
      <P>My career path has been a battle between my need to express my creative side as a musician, composer, and actor, and my need to support my family. Ideally those two requirements would meet in a single career, but until that happens Iâ€™m happy to be a developer during the day, and a performer in my spare time. Writing code exercises the same neural nets as composition: just using different hardware and notation, and satisfying a different set of users.</P>

      I originally created a hospital transcription program using Corel WordPerfect, but was asked at the end of 2001 to rebuild the functionality using MS Word instead. It uses two MS Access database files, one for document tracking, and one for product definition. This flexibility allows the user to define new reports, add physicians, and customize output, including exporting files in Cquence format. Transcriptionists can also interact with a secure web page to cut and paste blocks of information about patients directly into the program.
