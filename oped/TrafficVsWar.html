        <P>Every year on November 11 we make a point of remembering all those who died due to war.
            World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history, killing 70 - 85 <I>million</I> people (see
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties">Wikipedia</a> and the excellent interactive film
            <a href="http://www.fallen.io/ww2/#">The Fallen of World War II</a>). Remembrance Day is when we are encouraged
            to remember those deaths, and all those that came before and after due to military conflict, in hopes that if we
            truly understand the scope of the horror, we will do everything we can to avoid causing a similar situation.
        <P>The number of war dead has fluctuated ever since, but has never come close to the appalling heights of WWII.
            No equivalent complete set of data is available for traffic deaths. Even today, some countries do not track traffic
            deaths, and others underreport, so the figures in the chart below are approximate, based on changes in global
            population and traffic safety.
        <P> How do traffic deaths compare with those due to armed conflict?
        <ul>
            <li>70 - 85 million: number of dead in WWII</li>
            <li>~7.5 million: number of war dead 1950 - 2022</li>
            <li>~77 million: number of traffic dead 1950 - 2022</li>
        </ul>
        <P>The number of people killed by motor vehicles since 1950 is comparable to the number of people
            killed in World War II, and <I>ten times</I> the deaths worldwide due to armed conflict over the same period.
            It's just that traffic deaths occur one by one, and have gradually increased over time so that we become
            accustomed to the horror.
        </P>
        <P>Since 1993, some have observed a second Remembrance Day, on the third Sunday of November: the
            <a href="https://worlddayofremembrance.org/">World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims</a>.
            If we take remembering WWII seriously at all, we ought to be remembering our accumulated traffic dead at least as seriously.
            And if the intent of remembering is to make a change in the world rather than just to perform social theatre, we should foster a 
            data-driven mindset and take the risk and threat of traffic about ten times more seriously than the risk of war.
            To solve this problem we need to reengineer our societies and cities to reduce the impact - literal and figurative - of cars and traffic.
        </P>
        <P>Not many of us can do anything about stopping war. We can help the victims, but we can't stop politicians from making poor choices. However, 
            every one of us can make a better choice in our daily lives. Someone dies as a result of a motor vehicle accident somewhere in the world about
            every 26 seconds. Every one of those deaths started with someone saying to themselves "I think I'll take the car today."            
        </P>

            War dead by year taken from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace">Deaths in State-Based Conflicts by
                Region</a>.<br>
            Traffic deaths 1990-2019 taken from <a
                href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/road-traffic-deaths-sdgs?tab=table&time=earliest..2019">Our
                World In Data</a>
            Traffic deaths prior to 1990 were extrapolated from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year">Motor Vehicle Fatality
                Rate in U.S. by year</a> then scaled up using <a
                href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year">World
                Population By Year</a> starting in 1951, and then further adjusted to account for differences between U.S. and world.<br>
            I recognize that this is a poor proxy. Traffic safety
            in the U.S. has continued to improve even as the number of vehicles has grown, which is not true for much of
            the world, Africa especially. On the other hand, the U.S. and similar countries such as Canada have infrastructure which encourages
            or even mandates driving. These imprecise numbers are for illustration, and are only broadly accurate<br>
        </P>
        <P style="font-size:80%;">What about my country of Canada? For war dead we lost ~68,000 in WWI, ~47,000 in WWII, 516 in Korea, and 158 in Afghanistan.
            Traffic deaths appear to be going down
            (see <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/statistics-data/canadian-motor-vehicle-traffic-collision-statistics-2021">Canadian Motor Vehicle Traffic Collision Statitics</a>
            and the average deaths per year the last two decades is about 2000, so over the last 24 years about the same number of people have died on 
            Canadian streets as died in WWII. People in the U.S. are three times more likely to die in traffic than in Canada (in 2021, 
            12.89 vs 4.27 fatalities per 100,000, respectively).
