        <P>Every year on November 11 we make a point of remembering all those who died due to war.
            World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history, killing 70 - 85 <I>million</I> people (see
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties">Wikipedia</a> and the excellent interactive
            film
            <a href="http://www.fallen.io/ww2/#">The Fallen of World War II</a>). Remembrance Day is when we are
            encouraged
            to remember those deaths, and all those that came before and after due to military conflict, in hopes that
            if we
            truly understand the scope of the horror, we will do everything we can to avoid causing a similar situation.
        <P>The number of war dead has fluctuated ever since, but has never come close to the appalling heights of WWII.
            No global set of data is available for traffic deaths. Some countries still do not track the number of
            deaths due to traffic, and others underreport them, but it's possible to approximate them based on known
            figures for global population and traffic fatality rates in those countries where data are available.
        <P> How do traffic deaths compare with those due to armed conflict?
        <ul>
            <li>70 - 85 million: number of dead in WWII</li>
            <li>~7.5 million: number of war dead 1950 - 2022</li>
            <li>~77 million: number of traffic dead 1950 - 2022</li>
            <li>21 days: how long it takes for the number of people killed by traffic around the world to equal Canada's
                total war dead from WWII</li>
        </ul>
        <P>The number of people killed by motor vehicles since 1950 is comparable to the number of people
            killed in World War II, and <I>ten times</I> the deaths worldwide due to armed conflict over the same
            period.
            The war dead are elevated as heroes, in the belief, or at least the hope, that their deaths were a necessary
            sacrifice to achieve a worthwhile cause. In contrast, every traffic death is unnecessary, and is not a
            sacrifice but a tragedy.
        <P>North American cities have been designed to encourage vehicle traffic. Cities subsidize cars by building
            straight roads that facilitate high speed, wide roads and parking lots so that drivers can park their cars
            at public expense, and frequently maintained roads to deal with the erosion and damage done by motor
            vehicles. Then its citizens pay a "car tax" in the form of a police force that has to spend much of its time
            keeping road users safe from each other, and emergency responders and hospitals ready to deal with the
            constant flow of suffering from thousands of casualty crashes every year on Vancouver Island alone.
        <P>If we are to take remembering WWII seriously at all, we ought to remember our accumulated traffic dead at
            least as seriously. And if the intent of remembering is to make a change in the world rather than just to
            perform social theatre, we should foster a data-driven mindset and take the risk and threat of traffic about
            ten times more seriously than the risk of war. This implies the need to reengineer our culture and cities to
            reduce the figurative and literal impact of cars and traffic.
        <P>Not many of us can do anything about stopping war. We can help the victims, but we can't stop politicians
            from making poor choices. However, we can make better choices in our daily lives, especially here in
            Victoria which has one of the nicest climates for biking and walking in the entire world. When we drive, we
            effectively vote for more roads, more traffic, less effective public transit, deaths, injuries, air and
            water pollution, traffic noise, urban sprawl, and a weaker democracy due to political interference from
            vested interests such as the fossil fuel industry.
        <P>Since 1993, some have observed a second Remembrance Day, on the third Sunday of November: the <a
                href="https://worlddayofremembrance.org/">World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims</a>. Last
            September, one of those victims was a 76-year-old pedestrian on Interurban Road. Last May, one of them was
            Oak Bay Public Works inspector Steve Seekins, killed by a driver of an SUV in Oak Bay. Two years ago, one of
            them was Saanich Grade 11 student Kaydence Bourque, killed by a driver of a pickup truck on Cedar Hill Cross
            Road. Most of us know someone, or at least know <I>of</I> someone, whose life has been shattered or ended due
            to a motor vehicle accident.
        <P>Someone dies as a result of a motor vehicle accident somewhere in the world about every 26 seconds. Each of
            those deaths was caused by someone saying to themselves "I think I'll take the car today.‚Äù Do you feel
            comfortable in that driver's seat?</P>

                    in the U.S. has continued to improve even as the number of vehicles has grown, which is not true for much of
                    the world, Africa especially. On the other hand, the U.S. and similar countries such as Canada have
                    infrastructure which encourages
                    or even mandates driving. These imprecise numbers are for illustration, and are only broadly accurate.</LI>

        <P style="font-size:80%;">What about my country of Canada? For war dead we lost ~68,000 in WWI, ~47,000 in WWII, 516 in Korea, and 158 in Afghanistan. Traffic deaths appear to be going down
            (see <a
                href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/statistics-data/canadian-motor-vehicle-traffic-collision-statistics-2021">Canadian
                Motor Vehicle Traffic Collision Statitics</a>
            and the average deaths per year the last two decades is about 2000, so over the last 24 years about the same number of people have died on
            Canadian streets as died in WWII. People in the U.S. are three times more likely to die in traffic than in Canada (in 2021,
            12.89 vs 4.27 fatalities per 100,000, respectively).
