        Starship Canada is headed straight for a black hole, and Scotty's in the captain's chair. His real name is Stephen Harper, his engines are Canada's economy, and the black hole is the end of the oil economy.
      </P>
      <P>
        In the old Star Trek episodes, Scotty hardly ever got to command from the bridge, and only while the ship was in orbit. He was properly concerned with his beloved engines, and he was never happier than when he was able to keep them humming along efficiently. His favourite claim is to have kept the engines running smoothly during difficult times.
      </P>
      <P>
        Compare Scotty with Kirk (insert intelligent statesman here). He constantly asks Scotty to do unpleasant things to the engines: make them go too fast, throttle them back to "space normal speed", risk core breaches, etc. Why does Kirk do this? Because he knows something that Scotty doesn't:  the ship is heading straight into a black hole, or the Romulans are on their tail, or there's a diplomatic reason why the ship must delay its arrival.
      </P>
      <P>
        Spock (i.e. the science advisor) hasn't been on the bridge since early 2008, when Scotty fired him and, in a shocking move, closed the Office of the National Science Advisor. Spock would have been able to tell Scotty about the looming black hole, but Scotty is not concerned about externalities such as this - he's concerned as always with his engines. Scotty wouldn't have found Spock an easy man to work with in any case, as Scotty prefers men like Gary Goodyear, who he appointed as his Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, a man who believes that questions about evolution and biology are religious questions with religious answers.
      </P>
      <P>
        Uhura keeps receiving transmissions from other ships, but if the message says anything about changing course or speed, Scotty ignores it. We can see other ships of state veering away from the oncoming danger, but by maintaining our course and speed we're actually hindering the ability of the other ships to make necessary changes. At the Copenhagen Summit, Canada was perceived as actively obstructing progress to try to move towards a survivable, if not sustainable future. Our foreign policy is such a joke that we were removed from the UN Security Council.
      </P>
      <P>
        Internally, Scotty's command is ripe with dysfunction as his staff take advantage when they can (such as fraudster Bruce Carson), falsify documents (such as Bev Oda), or restrict access to information (such as senior federal scientists at Environment Canada being required to seek permission from the government prior to giving interviews, and to get their written responses approved). So long as the engines keep running smoothly, apparently anything goes. And whenever there's the threat of some other ship's officer taking over, or when the conversation gets a little gnarly with talk of Afghan detainees or stacking the Senate or budget reform, Scotty presses the "reset" button, and goes to the Governor General to prorogue parliament or call an election.
      </P>
      <P>
        Of course a starship's engines are vital - without them, the starship can't go anywhere. But Scotty must not be allowed to keep driving, or he'll focus so heavily on keeping the engines operating efficiently that he'll miss opportunities to change direction until it's too late.
      </P>
      <P>
        In contrast, Kirk would point the ship where it needed to go in order to survive, and order Scotty to do to the engines whatever it takes to get there. Kirk (whoever he or she is) needs to start turning the ship, and at the speed we're going we have an enormous turning circle. Some combination of the following will undoubtedly help: raise fuel taxes to the point where private gasoline-powered cars are too expensive to drive; develop the energy grid to use primarily sustainable energy sources such as wind, geothermal, solar, and water; apply and enforce caps on harmful emissions; and invest heavily in an educated ship's crew. The point of a starship of state like Canada is not to keep the engines going, but to travel into the future in a way that keeps the crew safe while achieving its long-term goals.
      </P>
      <P>
        I'm sure that Scotty (Stephen Harper) would be welcome as a part of any corporate boardroom: he's good at running a business. However, Starship Canada is not a business, and it has different priorities. Get Scotty off the bridge!
