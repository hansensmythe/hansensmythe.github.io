    <h2>Crazy Factor</h2>
    <p>Ingrid and I invented a version of Crazy Eights many years ago, based on factors and multiples rather than pip values and suits. But what gave this game a lot more interest is when those rules are paired with standard Crazy Eights rules.
    <p>Crazy Factor is a shedding game for 2-5 players.
    <ul><li>Deal the same number of cards to each player. (If playing with 4 or 5 players, you might want to shuffle two decks together) We typically deal 11 cards.</li>
    <li>Put the rest of the deck face down where everyone can reach it. This is the stock.</li>
    <li>Take the top card from the stock, and put it face up next to the stock. This is the discard pile.</li>
    <li>Players take turns either placing a card on the discard pile (if it is a legal card), or taking the top card from the stock.</li>
    <li>The rule in play is not defined at the start of the game. The first player to discard can play a legal card under either set of rules. So long as the rule remains ambiguous, you can play any card that is legal under BOTH sets of rules. As soon as you play the first card that is legal under only ONE set of rules, that set of rules is in play until it changes (see below).</li>
    <li>Each set of rules has a "magic card" that causes a flip to the other set of rules. The "magic card" in Crazy Eights is an 8 (which causes the rules to flip to Factor) and the "magic card" in Factor is a King (which causes the rules to flip to Crazy Eights). If the rules are ambiguous, there is no "magic card". For example, if rules are ambiguous and the top card is a 6 of hearts, if you play an 8 of hearts you have changed the rules to Crazy Eights. However, it was not a magic card when played, so the next card must be either an 8 or a heart (Crazy Eights rules) not a factor of 8 (Factor rules).</li>
    <li>There is one exception: if the <i>first</i> card in the discard pile is an 8, the rules immediately are defined as Factor rules, and if the first card in the discard pile is a King, they are defined as Crazy Eights rules. Alternatively, you can shuffle that card back into the deck and start with a different card.</li>
    <li>If the stock runs out, take the top card off the discard pile, shuffle the rest of the discard pile, and put it face down as a fresh stock. (Alternatively, you could end the game there and call it a draw, but we never play that way.)</li>
    <li>The first player to run out of cards in their hand is the winner. We don’t bother scoring points off what cards the losers have.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What is a legal card depends on which set of rules are in force at the time.
    <table border=1><tr><th>Crazy Eights rules</th><th>Factor rules</th></tr>
    <tr><td>You can put down any card that is the same suit or the same value, e.g. if 10 Clubs is the top card on the discard pile, you could play any Club, or any 10.</td>
    <td>You can put down any card that is a multiple or factor of the exposed card, e.g. if 10 (suit doesn’t matter) is the top card on the discard pile, you could play any Ace (1), or 5, or 10, as they are the only factors of 10 in the deck. Jacks are worth 11, and Queens are worth 12.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Notwithstanding the above, you can play an 8 at any time, on any card. This causes the game to flip to Factor rules. The player who played the card declares what pip value the card is meant to be, e.g. "Factor - Queen". You'd choose something either good for you or likely to make it hard for your opponent (e.g. a 7 or Jack).
    <td>Notwithstanding the above, you can play a King at any time, on any card. This causes the game to flip to Crazy Eights rules. The player who played the card declares what suit the card is meant to be, e.g. "Crazy Eights - hearts".</td></tr></table>
<h3>Sample starts</h3>
<p>First card turned over is a King of Hearts. This immediately forces the rules to be Crazy Eights (if it had been Factor, the King would have switched the rules to Crazy Eights, and if it were Crazy Eights, the King would have no effect.). The next card would have to be a heart or a King (or an 8, which would flip the rules to Factor).
<p>First card turned over is an 8. This immediately forces the rules to be Factor (if it had been Crazy Eights, the 8 would have switched the rules to Factor, and if it were Factor, the 8 would have no effect). The next card would have to be an Ace, 2, 4, or 8 (or King, which would flip the rules to Crazy Eights).
<p>First card turned over is a Queen of Spades. The first player could keep things ambiguous by playing any Queen, or the Ace, 2, 4, or 6 of Spades (these would all be legal under both sets of rules), or force rules to Crazy Eights with a King, or any Spade not mentioned above, or force rules to Factor with an 8, or an Ace, 2, 4, or 6 that is not a Spade. We sometimes can play half a dozen cards under an ambiguous rule set before someone is forced to flip the rules one way or the other.
<p>Note: if the rules have not yet been set, and a potentially wild card is played, if it's still a legal card under both sets of rules, the situation remains ambiguous. For example, if the 4 of spades is in play, you could play an 8 of spades and keep things ambiguous, but if you played an 8 of hearts (changing the suit), that would flip the rules to Factor, and if you played the King of spades (keeping the suit but not being a factor), that would flip the rules to Crazy Eights.
<p>Hint: if you see that your opponent has only one card left, and the only legal card you can play will obviously allow your opponent to win (e.g. playing an Ace under Factor rules), pick up a card rather than play your card. You don't have to play a card, even if it's the only legal card in your hand.
