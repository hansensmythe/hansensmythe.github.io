        <li>
        I think I had one of the best ideas of my life when I came up with <a href="./oped/placenotation.html">Dot Place Notation</a> - a way to write note lengths that previously required two or more tied notes, with implications for how complex time signatures could be notated. This expanded the rhythmic frontiers of my compositions - I became particularly interested in what music sounded like when each quarter note actually consisted of five pulses, not four, such as in my piece <a href="https://soundcloud.com/steve-hansen-smythe/engagement">Engagement</a> (2005).
