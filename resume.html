      <H3>Employment History</H3>
      <P><a href="https://www.appdirect.com" style="font-weight: bold" target="_top">AppDirect</a>. (Before it was purchased by AppDirect, it was AppCarousel, formerly WMode): Java/Node.js programmer; 7 November 2005 - 13 June 2025</P>
      <UL><LI>Built Node.js and Java modules used by apps in luxury vehicles for <a href="http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/gl/en/">JLR</a>, for displays operated by <a href="https://www.tpvision.com/">TP Vision</a>, and for payment solutions operated by <a href="https://www.verifone.com/en/us">Verifone</a>. Introduced APISIX to the JLR team. Implemented PlantUML to create C4 diagrams for the JLR code base.</LI>
      <LI>Going further back in time, I built a tool to enable mass uploads of ringtone applications to <a href="http://ca.blackberry.com/">RIM</a>, was part of the Brandstore development team for Rogers, Alltel, Cricket, BASE, and Public Mobile (and still maintain this system for BASE), implemented Unica's NetInsight web analytics package for various mobile service providers, and built a search engine for wireless products using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/">Lucene</a>.</LI></UL>
      <P><a href="http://www.criticalcontrol.com/" style="font-weight: bold" target="_top">CriticalControl Solutions Inc.</a> (formerly 'WNS Emergent', and before that 'Datap'): Java programmer and Crystal Reports developer; 14 August 2000 - 4 November 2005</P>

      <UL><LI>I originally created a hospital transcription program using Corel WordPerfect, but was asked at the end of 2001 to rebuild the functionality using MS Word instead. It uses two MS Access database files, one for document tracking, and one for product definition. This flexibility allows the user to define new reports, add physicians, and customize output, including exporting files in Cquence format. Transcriptionists can also interact with a secure web page to cut and paste blocks of information about patients directly into the program.</LI></UL>

      <LI>For Engineering and Environmental Services, Waterworks Division, I researched and tested half a dozen demonstration versions of training administration software, and made purchasing recommendations to the Department.</LI>
