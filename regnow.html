        I thought it would be useful for others to know to avoid <a href="http://www.regnow.com/">RegNow</a>. I paid $75 to them, and never received unlock codes for the software I had purchased, despite months of emailed entreaties. (Emails reproduced here do not include quoted material from previous emails, in the interests of brevity.)

      <P class="me">
        Here's what happened. I downloaded a trial version of Visual Orchestra (a CSound editor), and decided to pay $75 to get the unlocked version of the software. I then received the following email, ostensibly from D.W.Perry@fibre.a2000.nl (an email address which does not exist), in which the license code was replaced with a 404 error:

            Regnow, I note that the confirmation email did NOT include license codes for Visual Orchestra, but rather the guts of a 404 error page. Please send me license codes. If you cannot for some reason send me license codes, please refund my $78.92 CDN purchase price.

            Dear Laura L.:
          <P>
            I don't think you're going to find D.W.Perry at that email address - my email to him regarding the failure to receive a registration code for Visual Orchestra bounced.
          <P>
            Unless you have a newer email address for Mr. Perry, I think your only option is to refund the $78.92 Cdn I paid for registering his software.

            Dear RegNow customer support:
          <P>
            On 20 February you attempted to contact D.W.Perry@fibre.a2000.nl to inform him that I had not received a license code for Visual Orchestra, but instead had been emailed the text of a 404 error page like this:
            <br>
            &gt; &gt; Your license name is: Steve Hansen Smythe
            <br>
            &gt; &gt; Your license codes are:
            <br>
            &gt; &gt; ...The page cannot be found
            <br>
          <P>
            It's been four weeks, and I still have not received a license code, nor heard from D.W.Perry at all. I conclude that registering this product is no longer supported. Therefore, I request that the charge on my VISA account on 18 February 2008 be refunded:

            This is my third attempt to achieve resolution of this ongoing problem, without a response from you. (See attached previous correspondence.)
          <P>
            My only recourse, I feel, is to publish the correspondence to date, with appropriate words in the META tags which associate "Regnow" with "poor service", "cheat", "ripoff", and so forth. The problem is that the provider of the software (and the registration codes) has disappeared, and so cannot provide me with a registration code to unlock his software, but that YOU have still taken my money.
          <P>
            If I have not received a response and a refund within a week, I'll proceed with my plan to publish our correspondence to date (my correspondence, and your lack of the same). Although this may be a futile gesture of defiance, after two and a half months of being ignored, it's all I have.

            But the website and support email no longer exist! Have you understood <I>nothing</I>? <B><FONT color=red>YOUR VENDOR NO LONGER EXISTS. THEREFORE THE VENDOR'S SOFTWARE NO LONGER CAN BE REGISTERED, BECAUSE THE VENDOR NO LONGER SUPPLIES LICENSE CODES.</FONT></B>
          <P>
            Regnow seems to have great difficulty believing that one of their vendors has vanished. I invite you to try going to the support site, or to contact the vendor using the email address you supplied. They don't work. Furthermore, you have had three months to try to FIND this vendor, and have evidently failed to do so. Your only recourse is to refund my money ($75 US), as I have paid for license codes, but have not received them.

            I note that despite assuring me that this issue has been sent to your "escalation team", and that you "understand that it is our utmost priority to complete your request as quickly as possible", that it has been four months since your email, and I have not heard anything further from you, nor received license codes, nor received a refund. This issue has festered unresolved since February.
          <P>
            I have published our correspondence at http://members.shaw.ca/stevehs/regnow.html, in hopes of warning others away from your so-called service.
          <P>

            Dear Steve Hansen Smythe,
          <P>
            Thank you for contacting RegNow!.
          <P>
            We apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, due to the age of order number 1203304288-12235-582053, it is outside our influence as a third party processing service to pursue support on your behalf.
          <P>
            For technical support, contact the vendor at the following:

            How can I begin to address your farcical response? I am not asking for you to pursue support from the vendor because <FONT color=red><B>YOUR VENDOR NO LONGER EXISTS. THEREFORE THE VENDOR'S SOFTWARE NO LONGER CAN BE REGISTERED, BECAUSE THE VENDOR NO LONGER SUPPLIES LICENSE CODES</B></FONT>. I am asking you to refund my money, and have been asking this since March 2008. To claim that my complaint is too old to deal with is galling and entirely due to utter inaction on RegNow's part, and to direct me once again, after all that I have written, to nonexistent URLs and emails is beyond belief.
          <P>
            Do not bother to reply, unless it is to say that you understand the problem, and that you will refund my money. Our previous correspondence, with comments, is attached.
